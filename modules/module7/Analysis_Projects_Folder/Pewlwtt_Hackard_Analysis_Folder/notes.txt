In 7.2.2, there is no lightning bolt. It is a triangle pointin to the right.


I have trouble - I defined a primary key int the title db table
titles.csv has a duplicate employee ids. So emp_no cannot be a primary key!

# Use INTO to create a new table with results
SELECT first_name, last_name
INTO retirement_info
FROM employees
WHERE (birth_date BETWEEN '1952-01-01' AND '1955-12-31')
AND (hire_date BETWEEN '1985-01-01' AND '1988-12-31');
